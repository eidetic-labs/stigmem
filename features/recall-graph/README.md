# Recall Graph

Recall graph preserves the advanced graph adjacency index, embedding storage,
hybrid recall pipeline, memory cards, and causal-link design. The default
supported recall surface remains owned by `Spec-07-Recall-Pipeline`; this
feature record owns the deferred advanced graph material.
