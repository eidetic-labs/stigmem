# Helm Deployment

The Helm deployment feature contains the experimental Kubernetes chart and
operator recipe for deploying a Stigmem node with Helm. It includes chart
metadata, values, templates, secret-reference patterns, hardening defaults, and
operator setup guidance under `experimental/deploy-helm`.

The chart remains outside the current supported alpha deployment surface.
Docker Compose is the supported default path; Helm remains deferred until
operator validation, chart publication, hardening review, and ownership gates
complete.
