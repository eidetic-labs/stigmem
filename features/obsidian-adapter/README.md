# Obsidian Adapter

The Obsidian adapter synchronizes markdown vault content with a Stigmem node.
It has two experimental implementation surfaces: a Python CLI/daemon package
for Obsidian, Logseq, Dendron, and plain-folder vaults, and an Obsidian plugin
that runs inside the Obsidian process.

The adapter source exists under `experimental/obsidian-adapter` and includes
tests for the CLI and plugin. It remains outside the current alpha artifact set
until package, plugin, threat-model, and live-vault validation are complete.
