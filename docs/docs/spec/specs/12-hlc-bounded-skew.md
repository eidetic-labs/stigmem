**What this spec defines**

Bounds for remote Hybrid Logical Clock values accepted during
federation ingest. Limits how far a remote HLC may advance local
ordering relative to the receiver's wall clock and policy.

</div>

## Extraction status

This file contains the ADR-010 prose extraction for R-19
bounded-skew behavior. The basic HLC field and local advance rules
live in `Spec-01-Fact-Model`; federation ingest context lives in
`Spec-05-Federation-Trust`.

## Purpose

HLC values preserve causal ordering, but accepting arbitrarily
far-future remote HLCs lets a peer distort ordering and conflict
resolution. Bounded skew limits how far a remote HLC may advance
local ordering.

## Inbound bound

On federation ingest, a node MUST compare the inbound fact's HLC
wall component against its current wall clock. If the inbound HLC
exceeds the configured bound, the node MUST reject or quarantine
the fact according to local policy.

<div className="stigmem-keypoint">

**Default production posture: reject excessive skew.**

Development deployments MAY choose warn/quarantine modes when
explicitly configured.

</div>

## Audit and metrics

Nodes SHOULD emit an audit event for rejected or quarantined skew
violations. Metrics SHOULD include accepted skew distribution and
rejected-skew counts so operators can distinguish clock drift from
hostile peers.

## Conflict resolution relationship

Conflict resolution may use HLC ordering as a tie-breaker. Facts
rejected for bounded-skew violation MUST NOT participate in normal
conflict ordering.

## Out of scope

This spec does not define NTP configuration, wall-clock
synchronization operations, or replay nonce windows.
