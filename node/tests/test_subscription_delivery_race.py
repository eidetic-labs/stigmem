"""Regression test for issue #47 — concurrent ``deliver_pending`` and ``sweep_loop``.

Before migration 028 + the atomic-claim refactor, the delivery path was a
non-atomic SELECT (status='pending') + UPDATE (status='delivered').  Two
concurrent callers could observe the same row in their respective SELECTs
and each invoke the webhook, causing duplicate POSTs with the same
``event_id`` — exactly the flake reported in issue #47 against
``test_tombstone_filter.py``.

These tests assert the new atomic claim eliminates the race:

1. ``test_concurrent_deliver_pending_no_duplicate`` — many threads call
   ``deliver_pending`` in parallel.  Each event must deliver at most once.
2. ``test_sweep_loop_and_deliver_pending_no_duplicate`` — the background
   ``sweep_loop`` task runs alongside an explicit ``deliver_pending`` call.
3. ``test_stale_claim_recovered`` — an event that became stuck in
   ``delivering`` is reset to ``pending`` after the claim timeout.

    The regression target from issue #47 is *duplicate* delivery — the same
    ``event_id`` POSTed more than once.  Total POST count is incidentally
    interesting but unstable under CI load: the sanitizer pipeline can
    silently drop an event (ACL re-check or recall pipeline returns empty),
    and the failure path leaves a row in ``pending`` for the next sweep to
    re-claim.  Both behaviours are correct; what matters here is:

    1. No ``event_id`` appears more than once in the POST calls.
    2. Every event terminally settles (``delivered``) — no stragglers stuck
       in ``delivering`` or ``pending``.

    To absorb the legitimate retry path, after the racing workers finish
    we drain any remaining ``pending`` rows with a few extra single-threaded
    sweeps.  Those extra sweeps cannot mask a duplicate: if the racing
    workers had duplicated a delivery, the mock's call log already records
    it before the drain begins.
