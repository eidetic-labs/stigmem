## What this document is

A plain-English statement of what stigmem cannot safely do in its current state, organized by deployment scenario. It is the operator's companion to the formal [threat model](spec/security/threat-model.md) and the disclosure policy in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

If the threat model tells you *what the threats are*, this document tells you *what to actually do or not do today*. It is updated on every release. The contents below apply to **v0.9.0a1** specifically; future versions will close some of these gaps and may open new ones (each new feature lands with its own limitations entry).

If after reading this you're unsure whether your use case is safe, the answer is: ask in [Discussions](https://github.com/eidetic-labs/stigmem/discussions) before deploying. We'd rather lose an integration than have you hit one of these gaps in production.

---

## Current state in one sentence

Stigmem v0.9.0a1 is a working federated-memory reference node with a documented threat model and several controls our own threat model identifies as required for safe deployment that have not yet shipped. Those controls land during the v0.9.0bN beta series (see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)). Until they do, the deployment recommendations below are the responsible defaults.

---

## What stigmem is **not** safe for today

These are unambiguous "do not" recommendations as of v0.9.0a1.

### 1. Cross-organizational federation in adversarial settings

**Status:** mTLS for federation peering is not on by default. Capability-token validation at admission is partial. HLC bounded-skew enforcement is not yet shipped. Per-peer drift tracking does not exist.

**What this means:** if you peer with a stigmem node operated by an organization you do not already fully trust, a malicious peer can:

- Impersonate a legitimate peer (no client-cert verification by default).
- Push HLC values forward to corrupt fact ordering across the federation.
- Replay capability tokens within a window we have not yet fuzz-tested adequately.
- Write instruction-shaped facts that flow into your agents' context without a structural quarantine boundary.

**What to do today:** do not federate across organizational boundaries until the v0.9.0bN beta series ships. Single-organization federation between nodes you operate yourself is safer, but still subject to the limitations below.

---

### 2. LLM agents holding admin-scope API keys

**Status:** No structural prevention. The adapter contract treats this as an "operator configuration" concern.

**What this means:** if an LLM-driven agent is configured with an admin-scope API key (for example, by mounting it into an MCP adapter), a successful prompt injection on that agent grants the attacker full administrative control of your stigmem node — manifest publishing, key rotation, quarantine override, all of it.

**What to do today:** never issue admin-scope keys to anything an LLM can drive. Admin keys are for human operators and automation under human supervision only. Agent keys should be scoped to the minimum necessary (typically `local` or `team`, write access only to the relations the agent specifically needs). We are working on a structural fix that refuses such configurations at the API layer (the v0.9.0bN beta series).

---

### 3. Treating recalled facts as instructions to your agent

**Status:** Improved on `main`, but not yet release-certified or operator-soak validated. The old recall-time sanitizer remains defense-in-depth only. The ADR-003 structural design has landed for the core protocol surfaces: facts now carry `interpret_as`, instruction-typed writes require `instruction:write`, cross-org instruction-typed inbound facts are quarantined, `recall()` returns separate `content` and `instructions` channels, and MCP/OpenClaw consume the channel-separated response. ADR-015 `corpus-v1` now contains 80 validated prompt-injection patterns, and the certification runner supports deterministic offline runs plus OpenAI, Anthropic, and local Ollama provider adapters; reviewed public model results are still pending.

**What this means:** the protocol can now distinguish content from authorized instructions, but downstream safety still depends on adapter compliance, session propagation, and the consuming LLM honoring the system-prompt directive. Until the certification runner, public model results, and operator soak complete, this remains a hardening-in-progress surface rather than a production recommendation for adversarial cross-org workloads.

**What to do today:** treat recalled fact `value` fields as untrusted external data, the same way you would treat a user-uploaded document. Specifically:

- Do not concatenate fact values directly into a system prompt without a clear, structurally-delimited "untrusted data" framing.
- Do not allow agents to act on instructions found in fact values without a separate authorization step that does not depend on the fact's content.
- If you build adapters that consume `recall()` output, preserve the `content` / `instructions` separation and include the ADR-003 system-prompt directive. Treat uncertified models as an accepted operator risk.

The capability-based redesign is present on `main`; the v0.9.0bN beta series remains the target for release posture, certification evidence, and operator validation.

---

### 4. The agent feedback loop (read-injected → write-poisoned → replicate)

**Status:** Partially mitigated on `main`. Same-session read/write graph tracking rejects writes back into scopes a session has read unless the write carries explicit source-fact provenance, and `summarize_with_provenance` supports legitimate derived writes. Threat-model status is current; full adapter/session propagation evidence and outbound replication exclusion remain pending.

**What this means:** the most direct same-session worm path is blocked when clients propagate `Stigmem-Session` and provenance correctly. The risk is not closed until supported adapters propagate sessions by default and outbound replication excludes transitively recalled facts where required.

**What to do today:**

- Restrict agent writer keys to the narrowest possible scope. Agents should not hold writer keys for any scope they also read from where they consume cross-org content, period.
- If your agent must both read company-scope facts and write company-scope facts, the read content must come from sources you trust (your own organization's writes, not federated peers).
- Use session headers and `derived_from` provenance for any agent write derived from recalled facts.
- Treat OpenClaw as alpha/evaluation-only. The adapter now has audit-mapped C1-C4/H1-H5 regression coverage, fail-closed boot behavior, visible partial-write failures, channel-separated recall handling, and handoff-target allowlisting, but the broader R-21 risk remains open until supported adapters propagate sessions by default and outbound replication excludes transitively recalled facts.

---

### 5. Storing regulated data without explicit at-rest encryption

**Status:** SQLCipher at-rest encryption is supported but **not on by default**.

**What this means:** the default deployment writes facts to a plaintext SQLite file. Anyone with read access to the disk can read all facts.

**What to do today:** if you are storing PHI, PII, financial data, or anything else governed by regulation, you must explicitly enable SQLCipher per the [hardening guide](docs/security/hardening.md). The default setup is not appropriate for regulated workloads.

---

### 6. Cloud embedding with sensitive fact content

**Status:** Cloud embedding (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) is opt-in. The default deployment uses a local `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` model and never sends fact content to third parties.

**What this means:** if you opt into cloud embedding, **every fact's `entity + relation + value` string is sent to the embedding provider** during recall pipeline operation. Embedding providers may log, cache, or use that data per their terms of service.

**What to do today:** keep cloud embedding off for any deployment that handles sensitive data. If you need cloud embedding for performance or quality reasons, classify your data first and ensure your provider's terms align with your data-handling requirements. We do not yet check returned embeddings for adversarial manipulation by a hostile provider; that is a separate open risk (will be tracked in the next threat-model revision).

---

### 7. Production deployments without rate limits or audit logs

**Status:** Per-principal rate limits are not yet enforced. The audit log exists conceptually but is not yet WAL-ordered or persistent across the 13 documented event types.

**What this means:**

- A compromised API key can issue unbounded writes/recalls until you notice and rotate.
- A misbehaving agent can exhaust your storage or your CPU.
- You cannot reconstruct who-did-what from logs in a way suitable for incident response.

**What to do today:** treat v0.9.0a1 as a development and evaluation release. Production deployment is not recommended until the v0.9.0bN beta series completes (rate limits + persistent audit log). If you must deploy to production now, run behind a reverse proxy with its own rate limiting, and pipe stigmem's structured output to a SIEM you trust.

---

### 8. Long-lived API keys with weak hashing and no rotation

**Status:** Phase B moves new API keys to Argon2id hashing at rest (`node/src/stigmem_node/auth.py:_hash_key`) using the ADR-007 parameters. Legacy v0.9.0a1 SHA-256 rows remain valid during the v0.9.x migration window and are opportunistically rehashed to Argon2id on first successful use. **Separately:** automated rotation and an "expiring soon" admin surface are not yet available.

**What this means:** an attacker who obtains the api_keys table (e.g., via R-23 admin-level storage compromise, or via a separate exfiltration vector) faces Argon2id for new keys. Any legacy SHA-256 rows that have not been used or explicitly rotated still retain the older fast-hash posture until migration completes.

**What to do today:**

- **Treat the api_keys table as a high-value secret.** Restrict filesystem access to it. Don't back it up in clear-text. If you're using SQLCipher (`STIGMEM_AT_REST_KEY_PASSPHRASE_ENV` set — see Limitation 5), the table is encrypted at rest with an Argon2id-derived key, which substantially raises the bar — recommended for any deployment with regulated data or sensitive workloads.
- **Generate API keys at sufficient length** (the default caller-generated recommendation is 256-bit; don't override to anything shorter). Argon2id is defense-in-depth, not permission to use short or predictable keys.
- **Rotate keys manually on your own schedule** (recommend ≤90 days). Treat any key issued for testing or demo purposes as compromised once you've shared it with anyone outside the issuance context.

The remaining beta hardening work brings: automated rotation runbooks and an "expiring soon" admin surface.

**Why this changed:** release-readiness review for v0.9.0a1 caught that the implementation still used raw SHA-256 despite earlier prose saying Argon2id. Phase B corrects the implementation while retaining dual-mode verification for already-issued keys.

---

### 9. Running the OpenClaw bundled adapter as-is

**Status:** Most immediate OpenClaw safety issues have Phase B fixes landed. The
adapter separates retrieved content from instruction-channel recall output and
requires callers to place `SYSTEM_PROMPT_DIRECTIVE` above the delimited
`UNTRUSTED STIGMEM CONTENT` summary. Audit-mapped C1-C4/H1-H5 regression tests
now cover the known critical/high adapter findings. Broader R-21 hardening
remains in flight for supported-adapter session propagation and outbound
replication exclusion.

**What this means:** recent hardening has addressed API-key fail-closed behavior,
boot failure handling, target allowlists, visible multi-fact write failures, and
the OpenClaw content/instruction channel boundary. Recalled content is still
untrusted data. Do not treat retrieved facts as instructions unless a future
instruction-channel contract explicitly authorizes that use.

**What to do today:** treat the OpenClaw adapter as `experimental/` and outside
the supported production surface until #357 lands with tests. If you've
integrated against it, use private nodes, least-privilege keys, explicit handoff
allowlists, and avoid high-stakes workflows that inject recalled facts into an
LLM prompt.

---

### 10. Federation patterns not supported by the four-scope model

**Status:** The current scope model (`local` / `team` / `company` / `public`) is sufficient for single-organization deployments and trusted bilateral peering. It does not express several federation patterns that operators with multi-org or coalition deployments may need. Richer expressivity is planned for v1.x via memory gardens (currently experimental, see `Spec-X5`).

**What this means:** the following federation patterns are **not** supported in v0.9.0a1 and require either custom integration on top of stigmem or waiting for a future ADR-008 promotion of the basic memory-garden primitive:

- **Selective sharing with specific peers.** No way to express "shared with Partner Org B but not Partner Org C." Workaround: use `public` (over-shares to every peer) or run separate stigmem deployments per peering relationship.
- **Coalition or consortium membership.** No way to express a multi-org shared scope (e.g., a three-university research consortium). Workaround: separate stigmem deployment for the coalition.
- **Asymmetric trust between peers.** Trust is symmetric per peering agreement; capability tokens authorize *write* asymmetry but the four-scope model does not express *visibility* asymmetry between peers.
- **Project-bounded collaboration.** No way to express a per-project shared scope across orgs (e.g., "facts about Joint Project X are visible to both Org A and Org B; everything else stays internal"). Workaround: separate deployment per project.
- **Hierarchical organization relationships.** No native parent-subsidiary modeling. Each org is independent in the federation graph; a parent company cannot natively express "share these facts with all my subsidiaries but not external peers."
- **Compliance-aware scopes.** Regulated data (PHI, PII, financial) must be handled by operator-layer policy. The scope model is not compliance-aware; operators must layer classification, retention, and audit-trail requirements on top.
- **Time-bounded shared scopes.** Per-fact `valid_until` covers fact-level expiry; the four-scope model does not express "this scope's contents are visible to peer X for time T."
- **Read-vs-write asymmetry per peer at the scope level.** Capability tokens distinguish read from write at the verb level, but combining scope + token to express "Peer B can read scope X, but not write to it" is awkward and requires careful operator configuration.

**What to do today:** if your federation use case is single-organization or trusted bilateral peering, the four-scope model is sufficient. For coalition, multi-peer, or project-bounded patterns, evaluate whether stigmem v0.9.0a1 meets your needs before deploying. The basic memory-garden primitive that addresses these patterns is targeted for v1.x after `Spec-X5` passes the ADR-008 gate process and is promoted from experimental into the supported surface. Operators with these requirements who want to influence prioritization should [open an issue](https://github.com/eidetic-labs/stigmem/issues) tagged `area/federation-expressivity`.

**Why we chose this for v0.9.0a1:** expanding the scope model in v1.0.0 would be exactly the kind of scope churn [ADR-002](docs/adr/002-v1-scope.md) is designed to prevent. The decision is to ship the smaller defensible thing (four scopes, simple federation) and grow expressivity through gardens once they pass the ADR-008 gates.

## Install footguns specific to v0.9.0a1

These are pre-release-era install behaviors that surprise adopters who don't expect them. Each is the *correct* behavior for a pre-stable release; documenting so the surprise is named, not eliminated.

### `pip install stigmem` returns "no matching distribution found"

**Cause:** v0.9.0a1 is a PEP 440 pre-release (`a1` = alpha 1). `pip` excludes pre-releases from default resolution; it returns a "no matching distribution found" error rather than installing the alpha.

**Fix:** add `--pre`:

```bash
pip install --pre stigmem            # SDK only (default)
pip install --pre stigmem[node]      # SDK + reference node service
pip install --pre stigmem[all]       # everything published from this monorepo
```

This is intentional — adopters running `pip install <pkg>` in CI shouldn't accidentally pull in pre-stable software. It will go away when v1.0.0 ships (no `--pre` needed for stable releases).

### `stigmem` is a meta-package, not the actual code

**What you get:** `pip install --pre stigmem` installs an empty wheel called `stigmem` plus its declared dependency `stigmem-py>=0.9.0a1,<1.0.0`. The actual SDK code is in `stigmem-py`. Adopters who run `pip show stigmem` see ~5 metadata files and no Python source — that's correct.

**Why:** the canonical name `stigmem` should resolve to a useful install. Most adopters want the SDK (the most common use case in client/server software). Operators self-hosting want the server, available via `stigmem[node]` or `pip install --pre stigmem-node` directly. Mirrors the pattern of `redis`/`psycopg`/`elasticsearch` — bare-name install always = client SDK.

**If you want the actual SDK code path:** `import stigmem` in Python imports from `stigmem-py`'s installed location. The meta-package's empty wheel doesn't intercept anything.

### npm SDK is scoped under `@eidetic-labs`

**What works:**
```bash
npm install @eidetic-labs/stigmem-ts                 # gets the most recent published version (currently a prerelease)
npm install @eidetic-labs/stigmem-ts@alpha           # gets the most recent 0.9.0-alpha.* prerelease
npm install @eidetic-labs/stigmem-ts@0.9.0-alpha.1   # explicit pin
```

**Why scoped:** npm's free-tier organization permissions don't allow team-bound package access controls; scoping under `@eidetic-labs` sidesteps that limitation entirely.

### npm `latest` dist-tag — what it means in this project

npm requires every package to have a `latest` dist-tag; there is no way to publish without one. By **standard npm convention** `latest` is interpreted as "the recommended stable version" — but the wire-mandatory rule means `latest` *exists* as soon as a package is published, regardless of stability tier.

**Our convention is different and explicit:**

> Until v1.0.0 GA ships, `latest` tracks the **most recent published version** — stable or prerelease. It walks forward through `0.9.0aN` and `0.9.0bN` releases automatically, then locks onto the v1.0.0 line at GA.

**What this means concretely:**

| Adopter command | What you get today (v0.9.0a1) | What you'll get over time |
|---|---|---|
| `npm install @eidetic-labs/stigmem-ts` | `0.9.0-alpha.1` | The most recent published version, advancing through `0.9.0-alpha.N` → `0.9.0-beta.N` → `1.0.0-rc.N` → `1.0.0` |
| `npm install @eidetic-labs/stigmem-ts@alpha` | `0.9.0-alpha.1` | The most recent alpha; locks at the last `0.9.0-alpha.N` once we move to beta |
| `npm install @eidetic-labs/stigmem-ts@beta` | (no version yet) | The most recent beta, once `0.9.0-beta.1` ships |
| `npm install @eidetic-labs/stigmem-ts@rc` | (no version yet) | The most recent v1.0.0 release candidate |

**Stability signal lives in the version string,** not the dist-tag. Any version ending in `-alpha.N`, `-beta.N`, or `-rc.N` is pre-stable and carries no compatibility guarantee. Adopters who need stability **must** pin a v1.x version once the v1.0.0 line ships. Until then, the version string is the only honest stability indicator.

This convention deviates from typical npm projects (where `latest` = stable). It exists because the alternative — leaving `latest` pinned at the very first prerelease until v1.0.0 GA — is worse for adopters: they'd silently get the oldest preview build forever, instead of tracking the most recent.

### pip `--pre` flag is required for pre-1.0 installs

**Why:** PyPI considers any version with `aN` / `bN` / `rcN` suffix a pre-release. `pip install` excludes pre-releases by default unless `--pre` is passed.

```bash
pip install --pre stigmem                     # required for the alpha/beta/rc lines
pip install --pre stigmem==0.9.0a1            # explicit pin
```

This is intentional — adopters running `pip install` in CI without `--pre` shouldn't accidentally pull in pre-stable software. It will go away when v1.0.0 ships (no `--pre` needed for stable releases).

### Pre-release packages don't auto-upgrade silently

**What this means:**

- **PyPI:** if you pin to `stigmem==0.9.0a1` and we publish `0.9.0a2` next week, `pip install --upgrade stigmem` won't pick up `a2` unless you also pass `--pre`.
- **npm:** `npm update @eidetic-labs/stigmem-ts` will resolve to whatever `latest` points at — i.e., the most recent published version under our convention above. If you want to stay on the alpha line specifically (and not jump to a beta when one ships), use `npm install @eidetic-labs/stigmem-ts@alpha`.

**Recommendation:** during the v0.9.0a* and v0.9.0b* pre-stable lines, explicitly pin (e.g., `0.9.0a1`) or explicitly request the line-specific dist-tag (`@alpha`, `@beta`). Auto-upgrade across release tiers is unsafe for pre-stable software anyway — we may break the wire format between alphas.

---

## What stigmem **is** reasonable for today

These are use cases where v0.9.0a1 is genuinely useful and the limitations above don't materially affect you:

### Single-node, single-organization, non-regulated experimentation

Running one stigmem node on your own infrastructure, populated by your own agents and tools, with no federation peers — this is the use case the current code base supports well. Recall works, scopes are enforced at the SQL layer, the typed-fact model with provenance is functional, and the local-only deployment removes most of the federation-specific risks above.

### Local development and prototyping

Developers building agent applications who want to evaluate whether typed-fact memory is the right shape for their problem. Pin to a specific v0.9.0a* version, expect breaking changes during the v0.9.0bN beta-series hardening window, and treat the data as throwaway.

### Internal tooling within a single trust boundary

Memory for developer tools, internal agents, and automation that lives entirely inside your organization's existing security perimeter, where the adversary model is "honest mistakes by colleagues" rather than "active attacker." The single-organization default is reasonable for this audience.

### Threat-model evaluation

Reading our threat model, comparing it to your own requirements, and giving us feedback. This is genuinely the most valuable thing the broader community can do for the project right now. The [threat model](spec/security/threat-model.md) and the [risk register](spec/security/threat-model.md#7-risk-register) are open for issue-by-issue scrutiny.

---

## What we recommend right now

### If you are evaluating stigmem

Read this document, read the threat model, run `make demo` locally, and decide whether the design fits your problem. Don't deploy yet.

### If you have already integrated against v1.0

Your code does not need to change today; the wire format hasn't changed. **Do not deploy in cross-org federation configurations.** Pin to v0.9.0a1 and expect minor breaking changes during the v0.9.0bN beta series. Read [the retraction post](https://dev.to/offbyonce/walking-back-our-v10-announcement-resetting-to-v090a1-as-the-first-build-al0) for context on the version change.

### If you want to be our first external operator

We're looking for one organization willing to run a stigmem node for 30 days against a real (non-critical) workload, with public bug reporting. We'll help you set up, watch you hit issues we couldn't anticipate, and credit you in the v1.0.0 release notes. [Open an issue](https://github.com/eidetic-labs/stigmem/issues) tagged `operator-candidate`.

### If you are auditing the security posture

Start with the [threat model](spec/security/threat-model.md). Cross-reference findings here. File issues for anything we've missed. Especially welcome: scenarios we haven't modeled, attacks our risk register doesn't cover, controls we claim that aren't actually enforced in code.

## Closing the gaps

The [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) at repo root is the public sequencing for closing the gaps named above. A condensed view, by version line:

| Limitation | Closes in | Tracked as |
|---|---|---|
| Cross-org federation safety (mTLS-default, HLC bounds, capability validation) | the v0.9.0bN beta series (federation hardening) | R-01, R-14, R-16 |
| Prompt-injection structural defense | the v0.9.0bN beta series (capability redesign) | R-05 (replaces sanitizer with capability model) |
| Agent feedback-loop attack | the v0.9.0bN beta series (capability redesign) | R-15 (new) |
| Persistent audit log | the v0.9.0bN beta series (federation hardening) | R-09 |
| Per-principal rate limits | the v0.9.0bN beta series (federation hardening) | R-02 |
| API key max-age & rotation | the v0.9.0bN beta series (federation hardening) | R-03 |
| OpenClaw adapter hardening | the v0.9.0bN beta series (capability redesign) | OpenClaw audit C-series |
| At-rest encryption defaults | the v1.0.0rcN release-candidate series (v1.0.0 GA) | R-04 |
| Embedding poisoning detection | the v1.x post-GA expansion (post-v1.0) | new entry |
| Federation expressivity (selective peer sharing, coalitions, project scopes) | the v1.x post-GA expansion (gardens via ADR-008 gates) | Spec-X5 |

After the v0.9.0bN beta series ships and a 30-day operator soak completes, this document will be updated to reflect what is actually safe in v1.0, what remains opt-in, and what is still on the roadmap.

## v0.9.0a1 architecture in flight

The default install of v0.9.0a1 ships with feature-specific code in `node/src/stigmem_node/` — `tombstones.py`, `instruction_migrate.py`, `card_materializer.py`, `source_trust.py`, `decay.py`, and others — for features that are deferred from v1.0 critical-path scope per [ADR-002](docs/adr/002-v1-scope.md).

This is by design as the alpha-line iteration semantics ([ADR-019](docs/adr/019-amendment-to-adr-001-prerelease-version-strings.md)) support: each PR in the v0.9.0a series extracts one cross-cutting feature into a plugin per [ADR-011](docs/adr/011-cross-cutting-extraction.md)'s C1 plugin architecture.

**What this means for you as an adopter today.** The v0.9.0a1 artifact still carries some deferred-feature code while the alpha extraction line catches up. On current `main`, lazy instruction discovery, time-travel queries, and RTBF tombstones are no longer available as default-install behavior: they require explicit experimental plugin registration, and `as_of` requests fail closed without `stigmem-plugin-time-travel`. A single-org adopter running `make demo` experiences single-tenant behavior with no tombstones, time-travel, lazy-instruction-discovery, advanced memory-garden ACL, or source-attestation activated. The v1.0 critical-path scope claim describes user-visible *behavior*, not code architecture.

**What changes between now and v1.0.0.** v0.9.0a2 through v0.9.0a8 each extract one cross-cutting feature into a separate plugin package (`stigmem-plugin-<feature>`). After v0.9.0a8, the default install will be true to ADR-011's commitment: core has no feature-specific code; cross-cutting concerns are expressed exclusively through the hook registry; plugins are opt-in.

**Current implementation status.** Main now includes the registry foundation, stable 22-hook call surface, entry-point discovery, dependency ordering, lifecycle health checks, operator CLI inspection, production signing/trust policy, and author/operator documentation needed to test extension points against the default install. Lazy instruction discovery, time-travel queries, and RTBF tombstones have been extracted into opt-in experimental plugin source packages under `experimental/`. Signed/package artifact evidence is deferred until the planned plugin set is built, so these packages should not yet be described as released installable artifacts.

[The retraction post](https://dev.to/offbyonce/walking-back-our-v10-announcement-resetting-to-v090a1-as-the-first-build-al0) calls this gap out explicitly. We chose to ship the honest reset before completing the architectural cleanup so adopters read against the actual shipped artifacts rather than future-state claims.

| Cross-cutting feature | Current home | Spec reference | Plugin destination | Target release |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lazy instruction discovery | `experimental/lazy-instruction-discovery/` source package; default routes require plugin registration/configuration | `Spec-X1-Lazy-Instruction-Discovery` | extracted opt-in plugin source; artifact evidence deferred | v0.9.0a2 |
| Content-addressed fact IDs | `node/src/stigmem_node/cid.py` | `Spec-21-Content-Addressed-IDs`; **stays in core** ([ADR-017](docs/adr/017-amendment-to-adr-011-cids-as-core.md)) | n/a | v0.9.0a3 |
| Time-travel queries | `experimental/time-travel/` source package; default `as_of` requests fail closed without plugin registration | `Spec-X3-Time-Travel-Queries` | extracted opt-in plugin source; artifact evidence deferred | v0.9.0a4 |
| RTBF tombstones | `experimental/tombstones/` source package; default routes and filters require plugin registration/configuration | `Spec-X2-RTBF-Tombstones` | extracted opt-in plugin source; artifact evidence deferred | v0.9.0a5 |
| Memory-garden advanced ACL | `node/src/stigmem_node/garden_acl.py` | `Spec-X5-Memory-Garden-Advanced-ACL` | `experimental/memory-garden-acl/` plugin | v0.9.0a6 |
| Source attestation | `node/src/stigmem_node/source_trust.py` | `Spec-X6-Source-Attestation` | `experimental/source-attestation/` plugin | v0.9.0a7 |
| Multi-tenant isolation | `tenant_id` in 23 core files | Deferred plugin work; no supported protocol spec yet | `experimental/multi-tenant/` plugin | v0.9.0a8 |

The CID exception is deliberate. CIDs are load-bearing for the storage immutability stack ([ADR-016](docs/adr/016-storage-immutability-enforcement.md) L3) and the prompt-injection trust boundary ([ADR-003](docs/adr/003-prompt-injection.md) L1–L2). Keeping CIDs as a plugin would mean default install lacks integrity verification that the spec's claims depend on; ADR-017 corrects that.

## How to read this document over time

Every release of stigmem ships with an updated LIMITATIONS.md. Each entry has one of three lifecycle states:

- **Open** — the limitation is real for this version. Follow the "What to do today" guidance.
- **Closed** — the underlying risk has been mitigated. The entry is removed from this document and a `CHANGELOG.md` entry records the closure with a link to the relevant PR or ADR.
- **Accepted** — we have decided not to mitigate, with stated rationale. The entry stays in this document indefinitely with a "Why we accept this" note.

If a limitation moves from Open to Closed in your installed version, you can read the threat-model risk register's status column to confirm. If you find a behavior in production that this document doesn't cover, please open an issue tagged `limitations-doc`. Documents like this one are only useful when they're complete, and we cannot be complete without your reports.
