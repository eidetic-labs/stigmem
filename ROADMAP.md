# Stigmem Roadmap

> Public roadmap for stigmem. Milestone-gated, not time-gated — version lines complete when their exit criteria are met.
>
> **Current published build:** v0.9.0a6. **Active release horizon:** v0.9.0a7 only (per [ADR-001](docs/adr/001-versioning.md) + [ADR-019](docs/adr/019-amendment-to-adr-001-prerelease-version-strings.md)).
> **Last updated:** 2026-05-23.

## How this roadmap is organized

This file is the strategic roadmap: it preserves the release-line horizon,
major workstreams, and gates that open later lines. Detailed release contracts
live in [`docs/internal/releases/`](docs/internal/releases/), using the format
defined in [`docs/internal/roadmap-standards.md`](docs/internal/roadmap-standards.md).

`ROADMAP.md` should not be the per-issue task board or the release-notes draft.
GitHub milestones track live execution; `CHANGELOG.md` records what actually
shipped.

---

## Version-line model

The work is organized into sequential version lines per [ADR-019](docs/adr/019-amendment-to-adr-001-prerelease-version-strings.md). Only one alpha artifact refresh is opened as an active release target at a time; future beta, release-candidate, and GA lines stay as policy horizons until alpha exit evidence justifies opening them.

| Version line | Goal |
|---|---|
| **`v0.9.0aN` — alpha series** | Public posture matches reality. v0.9.0a1 reset; a2+ artifact refreshes correct ClawHub/OpenClaw alpha framing; docs site restructured; modular spec migration completed per [ADR-010](docs/adr/010-modular-specs.md); cross-cutting features extracted to plugins per [ADR-011](docs/adr/011-cross-cutting-extraction.md). |
| **Future beta line — hardened core** | Opens only after alpha exit evidence supports it. Every Open risk in the v1.0.0 critical-path threat model must close before beta exit: capability redesign, federation hardening, Argon2id migration, OpenClaw safety, per-feature security colocation, storage immutability stack, and 30-day external operator soak. No active GitHub milestone exists yet. |
| **Future release-candidate and GA lines** | Opens only after hardened-core exit. Sigstore-signed releases; reproducible builds; SBOM; 3+ external operators in production. Wire format frozen. No active GitHub milestone exists yet. |
| **`v1.x.y` — post-GA expansion** | Experimental features graduate into the supported surface via [ADR-008](docs/adr/008-experimental-gates.md) reintroduction gates; cross-cutting features remain opt-in plugins per ADR-011; modular spec evolution. |

## Current Strategic Horizon

`v0.9.0a6` shipped the Memory Garden advanced ACL validation release: basic
garden CRUD, membership, and direct `garden_id` fact guards remain core, while
advanced cross-surface ACL behavior stays opt-in behind
`stigmem-plugin-memory-garden-acl`. The detailed release record lives in
[`docs/internal/releases/v0.9.0a6-roadmap.md`](docs/internal/releases/v0.9.0a6-roadmap.md).

`v0.9.0a7` is the active release horizon. It validates the source-attestation
plugin boundary: default installs do not enforce source-identity checks,
while plugin-loaded deployments can opt into assertion validation, recall
ranking signals, and federation inbound guards through
`stigmem-plugin-source-attestation`. The detailed release contract lives in
[`docs/internal/releases/v0.9.0a7-roadmap.md`](docs/internal/releases/v0.9.0a7-roadmap.md).

The broader alpha deployment sequence remains intact. The detailed alpha-series
phase plan, including the `v0.9.0a4` through `v0.9.0a8` planned extraction
horizons and Phase A exit evidence, lives in
[`docs/internal/releases/v0.9.0-alpha-series-roadmap.md`](docs/internal/releases/v0.9.0-alpha-series-roadmap.md).

| Horizon | Strategic purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `v0.9.0a3` | CID core/spec validation and the next alpha artifact refresh. | Shipped |
| `v0.9.0a4` | Time-travel query extraction into an opt-in experimental plugin; default `as_of` behavior fails closed without plugin registration. | Shipped |
| `v0.9.0a5` | RTBF tombstone extraction into an opt-in experimental plugin; default routes and filters require plugin registration. | Shipped |
| `v0.9.0a6` | Memory Garden advanced ACL extraction into an opt-in experimental plugin; basic garden CRUD and direct guards remain core. | Shipped |
| `v0.9.0a7` | Source-attestation extraction into an opt-in experimental plugin; default source checks remain inert without plugin registration. | Active |
| `v0.9.0a8` | Multi-tenant isolation extraction into an opt-in experimental plugin, completing the planned alpha extraction train. | Planned, not open |

---

## Future Horizon

Future beta, release-candidate, GA, and post-GA expansion work remains
milestone-gated. The detailed workstreams have been moved out of the public
roadmap and into internal future-horizon release docs:

| Horizon | Detailed plan | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| Future hardened core | [`docs/internal/releases/future-hardened-core-roadmap.md`](docs/internal/releases/future-hardened-core-roadmap.md) | Opens only after alpha exit evidence supports it. |
| Future release-candidate and GA | [`docs/internal/releases/future-rc-ga-roadmap.md`](docs/internal/releases/future-rc-ga-roadmap.md) | Opens only after hardened-core exit and a later RC observation window. |
| Post-GA expansion | [`docs/internal/releases/post-ga-expansion-roadmap.md`](docs/internal/releases/post-ga-expansion-roadmap.md) | Starts only after stable `v1.0.0` ships. |

---

## Experimental Extraction and Graduation

Alpha extraction and ADR-008 graduation are distinct lifecycle events. The
detailed process, worked example, five-gate graduation checklist, and founder
review checklist live in
[`docs/internal/releases/alpha-extraction-and-graduation.md`](docs/internal/releases/alpha-extraction-and-graduation.md).

---

## Spec naming convention

Per [ADR-010](docs/adr/010-modular-specs.md): the canonical spec naming is **`Spec-NN-Topic-Name`** (or **`Spec-XN-Topic-Name`** for experimental specs), with stable two-digit identifiers and descriptive names.

| Prefix | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `Spec-NN-` | Supported protocol component spec; in-tree at `spec/specs/NN-topic-name.md` | `Spec-01-Fact-Model`, `Spec-09-Audit-Log` |
| `Spec-XN-` | Experimental spec; lives at `experimental/<feature>/spec.md` per ADR-009's experimental-feature layout | `Spec-X1-Lazy-Instruction-Discovery` |

**The number is stable across renames.** If a spec's topic name changes, the number stays. New specs get the next available number; numbers are never reused.

### Why Legacy Section Numbering Is Still Visible

The pre-reset stigmem spec was a single monolithic document with sections
numbered 1 through 25. ADR-010 supersedes that model. The supported component
specs now live under `spec/specs/`, experimental specs live under
`experimental/<feature>/spec.md`, and `spec/PROTOCOL.md` is generated from
their frontmatter.

## Stability commitments by version line

Per [ADR-001](docs/adr/001-versioning.md) + [ADR-013](docs/adr/013-deprecation-policy.md):

- **Pre-1.0:** No stability guarantee. Breaking changes in any alpha or future pre-stable release; pin to specific versions; auto-upgrade is not safe.
- **`v1.0.0` and `v1.x`:** Wire format and public Python API are stable. Removing a public API requires a deprecation in v1.x followed by removal no earlier than v2.0.0.
- **Deprecated features:** supported through the rest of the major version they were deprecated in.
- **Experimental features:** subject to breaking changes in any release without notice; their use behind feature flags is at-your-own-risk.
