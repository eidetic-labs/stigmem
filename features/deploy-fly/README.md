# Fly.io Deployment

The Fly.io deployment feature contains the experimental recipe for running a
single Stigmem node, and optionally the dashboard, on Fly.io. It includes
Fly machine configuration, persistent-volume guidance, health checks, metrics,
OIDC secret setup, and SQLite/libSQL storage options under
`experimental/deploy-fly`.

Fly.io remains outside the current supported alpha deployment surface. Docker
Compose is the supported default path; Fly.io remains deferred until live
deployment validation, secrets posture review, persistence and restore
validation, dashboard validation, and ownership gates complete.
