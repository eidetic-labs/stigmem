# Security Evidence Registry — 2026-05-17 Internal Node Security Audit

**Scope:** `stigmem-node` v0.9.0a1 source review, completing in v0.9.0a2 release prep.
**Method:** source review of authentication/identity, input validation, federation, plugins, cryptography, storage, filesystem permissions, and logging/secrets behavior.
**Reviewer:** internal review with automated investigation agents and maintainer follow-up.
**Release target:** `stigmem-node 0.9.0a2` (advisory disclosures + hardening).

This page lists each audit finding, the code paths that implement the fix, the resolution PR, the regression evidence, and the disposition. Per the [Security Evidence Registry best-practices guide](./security-evidence-registry.md), a finding moves to **Closed** only when implementation, tests, version-introduced, and documentation evidence all agree.

## Additional Medium / Low dispositions documented in SECURITY.md

Rate-limit kill-switch acknowledgement, federation message validation, and OIDC discovery URL validation are captured in `SECURITY.md` as final Medium/Low dispositions. Per the v0.9.0a2 publication policy, Critical and High findings are disclosed through GHSAs; Medium and Low findings are documented in the public security posture unless their risk profile changes.

C3 federation transport guard / preflight and H6 federation authority verification independent of trust mode did not receive standalone advisories after triage. Their public disposition is captured by the existing federation hardening entries in `CHANGELOG.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and the threat-model evidence for the affected federation risks.
