# Spec-08-Quarantine-Garden

`Spec-08-Quarantine-Garden` defines the quarantine garden behavior used to
isolate facts from low-trust or failed-validation sources before they reach the
main recall surface.

## Extraction Status

This file contains the ADR-010 prose extraction for quarantine semantics.
General garden ACL is owned by `Spec-02-Scopes-and-ACL`; federation source trust
is owned by `Spec-05-Federation-Trust`; route shape is owned by
`Spec-03-HTTP-API`.

## Purpose

Quarantine is a safety boundary. A fact that cannot be trusted enough for normal
ingest may still be worth retaining for moderator review. Instead of silently
discarding it or admitting it into the main fabric, the node routes it to a
designated quarantine garden.

## Quarantine Admission

A node MAY quarantine inbound facts when:

- source-trust score is below the configured admission threshold,
- source attestation is missing or invalid,
- sanitizer policy selects quarantine mode,
- federation validation flags a reviewable but non-fatal issue, or
- operator policy explicitly routes a source to quarantine.

Facts admitted to quarantine MUST carry enough metadata to explain the
admission reason.

## Quarantine Garden Requirements

A quarantine garden is a Memory Garden with quarantine behavior enabled. It MUST
retain normal garden ACL properties and add a moderator role:

```text
QuarantineRole = "admin" | "quarantine:moderator" | "writer" | "reader"
```

Promotion and rejection require `admin` or `quarantine:moderator` in the
quarantine garden.

## Fact State

Quarantined facts SHOULD record:

```text
quarantine_garden_id: UUID
quarantine_status:    "pending" | "promoted" | "rejected"
quarantine_reason:    string
source_trust:         number?
```

Pending quarantined facts MUST NOT appear in normal recall/query results unless
the caller explicitly queries the quarantine surface and has permission.

## Promote

Promotion moves a pending fact out of quarantine and into either the main fabric
or a target garden. Promotion MUST record who promoted the fact, when, and why.
Promoting an already promoted or rejected fact MUST return a conflict response.

Promotion MUST re-check target garden scope and write permissions before moving
the fact.

## Reject

Rejection permanently marks a quarantined fact as rejected. Rejection MUST record
who rejected the fact, when, and why. Rejected facts remain available for audit
to authorized quarantine moderators, but MUST NOT enter normal recall.

## Deletion Guard

A quarantine garden with pending facts MUST NOT be deleted. The node must require
moderation of pending facts before deleting the garden container.

## Audit

Nodes SHOULD audit:

- quarantine admission,
- promotion,
- rejection,
- deletion blocked by pending facts,
- attempts to moderate without required role.

Audit record shape belongs to `Spec-09-Audit-Log`.

## Out Of Scope

This spec does not define source-trust formula details, source attestation,
sanitizer pattern catalogues, or advanced Memory Garden ACL behavior.
