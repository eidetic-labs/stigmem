"""BFS graph traversal — neighbors() implementation, spec §20.2.

Exported surface:
    bfs_neighbors(conn, seed_entity, max_depth, scope, tenant_id, ...) -> list[NeighborEntry]

Invariants honored:
  - Only traverses edges with confidence >= min_confidence and valid_until not expired.
  - Filters garden-tagged edges against caller ACL (§17.3).
  - Blocks federated edges (received_from is not null) if caller lacks federate perm (§19.5.2).
  - Relation filter supports prefix-glob only (e.g. "memory:*"), not full regex.
  - De-duplicates: each neighbor entity appears once at its shortest hop distance.
