# Spec-13-Capability-Based-Instructions

<p className="stigmem-meta"><span>2 min read</span><span>Spec contributor</span><span>Draft · future hardened-core line</span></p>

<div className="stigmem-lead">

**What this spec defines**

Structural separation between recalled content and executable
instruction, plus the capability gate required to promote memory
into instruction.

</div>

## Extraction status

This file contains the ADR-010 prose extraction for ADR-003
capability-based instruction handling. The first implementation
slice shipped in #373: `FactValue.interpret_as` exists, local
instruction writes require `instruction:write`, and recall
preserves instruction/content channels. The remaining
federation/admission pieces target a future hardened-core line and are not
part of the active alpha release horizon.

## Principle

<div className="stigmem-keypoint">

**Recalled memory is data.**

It MUST NOT become executable instruction merely because it appears
in context. Promotion from content to instruction requires an
explicit capability grant and a structurally separate channel.

</div>

## FactValue extension

The capability redesign introduces an instruction interpretation
marker on facts or recalled units. A fact marked as
instruction-like MUST be treated as data unless the caller has the
required capability to execute or inject that instruction.

## Write-time enforcement

Writing instruction-typed facts MUST require explicit
`instruction:write` authority. General `write` authority is
insufficient. Cross-organization instruction-typed facts SHOULD be
quarantined or rejected unless a trusted deployment relationship
explicitly permits them.

## Recall-time enforcement

Recall MUST preserve provenance and interpretation metadata. The
recall pipeline MUST NOT collapse untrusted content into executable
instructions. Agent runtimes must receive content and instructions
through separate structures.

## Federation boundary

Receiving nodes MUST NOT promote inbound content to instruction
based on a sender's assertion alone. Any instruction interpretation
that crosses federation must be revalidated against local policy
and capability grants.

## Audit

Nodes SHOULD audit instruction writes, rejected promotions,
cross-org instruction quarantine, and capability failures.

## Out of scope

This spec does not define lazy instruction discovery, boot-stub
delivery, or instruction manifest retrieval; those belong to
`Spec-X1-Lazy-Instruction-Discovery`.
