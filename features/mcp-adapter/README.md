# MCP Adapter

The MCP adapter exposes a running Stigmem node as Model Context Protocol tools
for stdio-capable agent hosts. `0.1.0` scopes validated host UI support
to Codex CLI, Claude Code, Gemini CLI with its final-response caveat, and
repo-local MCP protocol smoke. Continue.dev, Cursor, Zed, and custom-host use
remain experimental until host-specific smoke evidence exists. The adapter is a
stateless TypeScript process that translates MCP tool calls into HTTP requests
against the configured node.

The adapter source is active and tested. The `@eidetic-labs/stigmem-mcp`
package is independently versioned from the Stigmem project release line and
repo-local MCP protocol smoke passes against a live node. The `0.1.0` package
is public on npm as the manual bootstrap publication; future publications use
npm Trusted Publisher/OIDC via `.github/workflows/mcp-publish.yml`.
