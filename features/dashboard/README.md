# Dashboard

The dashboard is a deferred Next.js curator UI for Stigmem fact graph
operations. It provides an authenticated web surface, navigation shell, API
client utilities, session handling, and smoke/unit tests under
`experimental/dashboard`.

The dashboard remains outside the current alpha artifact set. It is preserved
as experimental internal tooling until ownership, deployment posture,
dependency currency, live-node validation, and UI security gates are complete.
