# Paperclip Adapter

The Paperclip adapter records Paperclip agent lifecycle events as Stigmem
facts. It provides a company skill, a JavaScript fact-emission helper, and a
shell hook that can assert checkout, issue status, blocker, heartbeat, handoff,
and decision facts from Paperclip-managed agent workflows.

The adapter is preserved as experimental external adapter surface area under
`experimental/paperclip-adapter`. It remains outside the current alpha artifact
set until ownership, installation packaging, live Paperclip validation, and
security review are complete.
