# Fuzzy Resolver

Fuzzy resolver is the core entity-resolution helper for matching variant entity
URIs to a canonical entity. It combines deterministic normalization, explicit
alias mappings, and same-type token scoring over the live fact graph.

The feature is experimental and outside the default critical-path surface. It
is implemented in core node code and exposed through authenticated entity and
alias APIs.
