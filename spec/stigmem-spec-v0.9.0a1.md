# Stigmem Protocol Specification — v0.9.0a1

**Status:** Canonical (in flight) — section-by-section review of pre-reset spec content against actual implementation in `node/` per master-checklist §4.3a "Spec review and canonicalization to v0.9.0a1."
**Applies to:** Stigmem v0.9.0a1 and reference node implementation.
**Last updated:** 2026-05-09.

> **About this document.** v0.9.0a1 is the first build of stigmem per [ADR-001](../docs/adr/001-versioning.md) + [ADR-019](../docs/adr/019-amendment-to-adr-001-prerelease-version-strings.md). The protocol-spec content evolved over multiple development checkpoints (snapshots preserved at [`spec/archive/evolution/`](archive/evolution/)). This document is the canonical destination — content is migrated forward from the most-complete pre-reset checkpoint (`stigmem-spec-v2.0.md`), reviewed section-by-section against `node/` implementation, and improved for clarity. Earlier evolutionary snapshots become reference material once a section's content has migrated forward.
>
> **Section status convention** ([ADR-012](../docs/adr/012-version-aware-feature-exposure.md)):
> - `Stable in v0.9.0a1` — committed contract; no breaking changes within v0.9.0a series within the section's wire-format scope.
> - `Experimental in v0.9.0a1` — implementation exists but the section's contract is not committed; reintroduction per [ADR-008](../docs/adr/008-experimental-gates.md) for any section that moves to `experimental/<feature>/spec.md`.
> - `Deferred from v0.9.0a1` — section's content moves to `experimental/<feature>/spec.md` per [ADR-002](../docs/adr/002-v1-scope.md) v1 critical-path scope decision.
>
> **Modular spec migration ([ADR-010](../docs/adr/010-modular-specs.md)) is v0.9.0bN beta-series work.** This document remains a single canonical file through v0.9.0a series; the decomposition into component specs (`spec/specs/01-fact-model.md` through `Spec-14`) lands in the v0.9.0bN beta series.1.

## How to read this document

Per [ADR-010](../docs/adr/010-modular-specs.md), the canonical spec naming convention is `Spec-NN-Topic-Name` for supported protocol component specs and `Spec-XN-Topic-Name` for experimental specs. Until the v0.9.0bN beta series's full per-spec file decomposition lands (master-checklist §5.1), this monolithic file remains canonical and the section-disposition table below uses **`Spec-XN-Name` as the primary identifier** with `[§N legacy]` as a transitional aid for readers familiar with the pre-reset numbering.

The spec is divided into supported protocol components (kept in this canonical file until extraction) and deferred sections (migrated to per-feature `experimental/<feature>/spec.md`).

## Section status

This file is a skeleton — content arrives section by section as the master-checklist §4.3a per-section review completes. Each migrated section gets a review note documenting:

- What `node/` files were cross-checked against the spec text.
- What discrepancies were found (with issue references for v0.9.0bN beta-series follow-up).
- What clarity improvements were made.
- What the section's status is (Stable / Experimental / Deferred).

Until a section is migrated, refer to the corresponding section in `spec/archive/evolution/stigmem-spec-v2.0.md` as the most-recent-but-superseded source. The v2.0 snapshot is the most complete pre-reset spec content; review-and-migrate is in progress.

## Cross-references

- [`spec/archive/evolution/`](archive/evolution/) — superseded evolutionary snapshots (`pre-reset` through `v2.0`). Each retains a banner pointing here.
- [`spec/EVOLUTION.md`](EVOLUTION.md) — spec-level changelog (renamed from `spec/CHANGELOG.md`).
- [`spec/security/threat-model.md`](security/threat-model.md) — threat model; section references in this spec link to the threat model's risk register.
- [`docs/adr/`](../docs/adr/) — architecture decision records governing the spec evolution.
- [`experimental/<feature>/spec.md`](../experimental/) — per-feature spec content for deferred sections.
