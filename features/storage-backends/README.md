# Storage Backends

Storage backends are the reference node persistence adapters behind the shared
`StorageBackend` interface. SQLite remains the default backend. libSQL/Turso
and Postgres are opt-in adapter surfaces for operators who need cloud-backed
durability, multi-region reads, or an existing managed database tier.

The feature record owns the backend-selection contract, shared adapter
lifecycle, evidence, and security posture. Backend-specific detail can live in
child records such as `storage-libsql`.
