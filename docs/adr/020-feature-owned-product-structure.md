# ADR-020: Feature-owned product structure and projection model

<p className="stigmem-meta"><span>8 min read</span><span>Proposed</span><span>Recorded 2026-05-21</span></p>

<div className="stigmem-lead">

**What this ADR decides**

Make the feature the canonical unit of Stigmem product truth. Every feature has
a stable feature record with the same required files, regardless of whether the
feature is core, plugin-backed, adapter-facing, SDK-facing, deployment-related,
experimental, deprecated, or deferred. Roadmap, release, security, changelog,
compatibility, and protocol-index documents become policy/narrative hubs or
projections over feature records instead of independent duplicate sources.

<div className="stigmem-keypoint">

**Experimental is a maturity state, not a documentation architecture.**

The current repo gives experimental features a better colocation model than
core features: experimental features often have a colocated spec, status file,
security notes, tests, and implementation package. Core features are spread
across `spec/specs/`, public docs, changelog entries, tests, and security
evidence. This ADR makes the feature record universal.

## Context

Stigmem currently has multiple documentation and implementation patterns for the
same conceptual object: a feature.

<div className="stigmem-grid">

<div><h4>Core features</h4><p>Normative behavior lives in <code>spec/specs/*.md</code>, public summaries in <code>docs/docs/</code>, implementation proof in code/tests/evidence files, release history in <code>CHANGELOG.md</code>, and security in protocol-level files.</p></div>
<div><h4>Experimental features</h4><p>Feature truth often lives together under <code>experimental/&lt;feature&gt;/</code>: <code>spec.md</code>, <code>STATUS.md</code>, optional <code>security.md</code>, tests, conformance, and package code.</p></div>
<div><h4>Release planning</h4><p>Strategic roadmap, release readiness, changelog, Internal-Comms drafts, PR bodies, and security evidence have historically repeated overlapping facts.</p></div>

</div>

This creates three recurring problems:

<div className="stigmem-fields">

<div>
<dt>Problem</dt>
<dt><span className="stigmem-fields__type">Effect</span></dt>
<dd>Why it matters</dd>
</div>

<div>
<dt>Feature identity depends on directory category</dt>
<dt><span className="stigmem-fields__type">structural</span></dt>
<dd>Core and experimental features use different mental models, even though both need a spec, status, evidence, security analysis, and release history.</dd>
</div>

<div>
<dt>Maturity is encoded as location</dt>
<dt><span className="stigmem-fields__type">brittle</span></dt>
<dd>A feature that changes maturity would need either a move or a misleading path. Stability should be metadata, not a directory prefix.</dd>
</div>

<div>
<dt>Top-level docs duplicate feature facts</dt>
<dt><span className="stigmem-fields__type">maintenance</span></dt>
<dd><code>SECURITY.md</code>, <code>CHANGELOG.md</code>, <code>spec/PROTOCOL.md</code>, compatibility tables, and public feature pages can drift when they repeat details maintained elsewhere.</dd>
</div>

<div>
<dt>Roadmap and release docs carry too much detail</dt>
<dt><span className="stigmem-fields__type">planning</span></dt>
<dd>One long roadmap becomes hard to maintain, but over-trimming loses strategic intent and implementation specificity.</dd>
</div>

</div>

The existing ADRs already point toward feature ownership:

- ADR-008 treats the feature as the unit of reintroduction readiness.
- ADR-010 colocates experimental specs with the features they describe.
- ADR-012 says stability and since-version should be visible on feature pages.
- ADR-018 says feature security should live with the feature.

They do not establish a single feature-owned record across core and
experimental features. This ADR fills that gap.

## Decision

Adopt a feature-owned product structure and projection model.

### 1 · Feature records are the canonical product truth

Every Stigmem feature has one canonical feature record:

```text
features/<feature-slug>/
├── README.md
├── spec.md
├── status.md
├── evidence.md
├── security.md
└── changelog.md
```

Feature slugs use lowercase kebab case and name the capability, not the
implementation mode:

```text
features/content-addressed-ids/
features/federation-trust/
features/time-travel/
features/openclaw-adapter/
```

Do not encode maturity or implementation type in the path:

```text
features/plugins/time-travel/      # no
features/core/content-addressed-ids/ # no
features/experimental/time-travel/ # no
```

### 2 · Required feature files have fixed roles

<div className="stigmem-fields">

<div>
<dt>File</dt>
<dt><span className="stigmem-fields__type">Owner</span></dt>
<dd>Purpose</dd>
</div>

<div>
<dt><code>README.md</code></dt>
<dt><span className="stigmem-fields__type">orientation</span></dt>
<dd>Feature overview, owner, maturity, implementation mode, package/import paths, and links to the other feature files.</dd>
</div>

<div>
<dt><code>spec.md</code></dt>
<dt><span className="stigmem-fields__type">normative behavior</span></dt>
<dd>Protocol, API, CLI, config, storage, plugin, or adapter behavior the feature promises.</dd>
</div>

<div>
<dt><code>status.md</code></dt>
<dt><span className="stigmem-fields__type">state and lifecycle</span></dt>
<dd>Current maturity, gate status, release history, known gaps, and what changed when.</dd>
</div>

<div>
<dt><code>evidence.md</code></dt>
<dt><span className="stigmem-fields__type">proof</span></dt>
<dd>Implementation paths, migrations, tests, conformance vectors, validators, release evidence, and coverage gaps.</dd>
</div>

<div>
<dt><code>security.md</code></dt>
<dt><span className="stigmem-fields__type">risk</span></dt>
<dd>Feature-specific threat-model deltas, mitigations, residual risks, safe/unsafe deployment modes, and advisory links.</dd>
</div>

<div>
<dt><code>changelog.md</code></dt>
<dt><span className="stigmem-fields__type">feature history</span></dt>
<dd>Detailed feature-local change history by release. Root <code>CHANGELOG.md</code> remains the curated project-level release ledger.</dd>
</div>

</div>

All six files are required for every feature. If a file has no feature-specific
content yet, it states that explicitly. Missing files are not used to imply "not
applicable."

### 3 · Feature metadata carries maturity and implementation mode

Feature maturity and type are metadata, not directory placement.

The feature `README.md` frontmatter defines the canonical metadata:

```yaml
---
feature_id: time-travel
title: Time-travel queries
status: active
stability: experimental
since: 0.9.0a1
owner: maintainers
feature_type: plugin
default_surface: opt-in
canonical_spec: Spec-X3-Time-Travel-Queries
package: stigmem-plugin-time-travel
implementation_path: features/time-travel/src/stigmem_plugin_time_travel
adr_refs:
  - ADR-008
  - ADR-011
security_refs:
  - R-17
release_lines:
  - v0.9.0aN
---
```

Allowed values:

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| `status` | `proposed`, `active`, `shipped`, `deferred`, `superseded` |
| `stability` | `stable`, `beta`, `experimental`, `deprecated` |
| `feature_type` | `core`, `plugin`, `adapter`, `sdk`, `deployment`, `protocol`, `tooling`, `docs` |
| `default_surface` | `default`, `opt-in`, `experimental`, `internal`, `external` |

`stability` follows ADR-012. `status` describes implementation and planning
state. A feature can be `status: shipped` and `stability: experimental`.

### 4 · Core and plugin implementation modes are both valid

This ADR does not require every feature to be a separate package. It defines
feature ownership and the canonical record.

Core/default implementation may live inside the importable core package:

```text
node/src/stigmem_node/features/<feature_name>/
```

Plugin or opt-in implementation may live directly in the feature directory when
the feature is a real Python distribution:

```text
features/<feature-slug>/
├── pyproject.toml
├── src/
│   └── stigmem_plugin_<feature_name>/
└── tests/
```

Adapters, SDKs, deployment surfaces, and tooling may keep their established
package roots when moving code would add packaging or import risk. Their
feature records still live under `features/<feature-slug>/` and point to the
implementation path.

Feature-specific implementation should move toward the feature-owned package or
`stigmem_node.features.<feature_name>` form when that move is technically safe.
Routine helpers and shared infrastructure do not become features only because
they are imported by features.

### 5 · Experimental is metadata, not a permanent feature category

`experimental/` is not a canonical feature documentation category after this
ADR. Experimental maturity is represented by feature metadata:

```yaml
stability: experimental
default_surface: opt-in
```

Existing `experimental/<feature>/` directories may remain during migration to
avoid unnecessary moves, packaging churn, or broken links. During transition,
they link to the canonical `features/<feature-slug>/` record.

### 6 · Existing high-level documents become hubs or projections

Feature files own feature facts. Higher-level documents own policy, narrative,
or projections:

| Artifact | Role after this ADR |
|---|---|
| `ROADMAP.md` | Strategic horizon and version-line sequencing. Links to feature records and release roadmaps; does not own feature detail. |
| `docs/internal/releases/<version>-roadmap.md` | Release contract: in/out scope, artifacts, evidence gates, feature changes, release-note candidates. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Curated user/operator-facing project release ledger, promoted from feature changelogs during release prep. |
| `SECURITY.md` | Reporting policy, supported versions, disclosure policy, current release posture, advisory index, and feature-security projection. |
| `spec/PROTOCOL.md` | Protocol index/projection over feature specs and protocol specs. |
| `spec/specs/*.md` | Compatibility/generated views during migration, not independent feature truth once migrated. |
| `docs/docs/concepts/features.md` | Public feature matrix projection over feature metadata. |
| `docs/compatibility-matrix.yaml` | Compatibility projection over feature metadata, package surfaces, and release support. |
| `spec/security/threat-model.md` | Protocol-level security hub and unified risk register; links to feature `security.md` files for feature-specific analysis. |

Generated or curated projections must not duplicate full feature content. They
link to the feature record for detail.

### 7 · CI validates feature records

The feature record contract is enforceable. CI validates:

- every feature directory has the required six files;
- every feature `README.md` has required frontmatter;
- enum values are valid;
- `feature_id` values are unique;
- `canonical_spec` values are unique when present;
- projection files are regenerated once generation tooling exists.

Transition allowlists may exist while legacy features are migrated, but the
allowlist is not a permanent exception mechanism.

### 8 · Migration planning lives outside the ADR

This ADR defines the target product/documentation architecture. Migration
sequence, pilot features, wrappers, tooling rollout, and PR slicing are tracked
outside the ADR in internal planning documents and release roadmaps.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Every feature has one canonical record.
- Core, plugin-backed, adapter, SDK, deployment, and experimental features use
  the same file contract.
- Root docs become smaller and less duplicative.
- Feature maturity is visible through metadata and history, not inferred from
  directory placement.
- Release roadmaps can identify changed features without owning all feature
  detail.
- Root `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `spec/PROTOCOL.md`, feature matrix, and
  compatibility matrix can become projections instead of hand-maintained
  duplicates.

### Costs

- Existing feature docs must be migrated.
- Spec and docs generators need to learn the feature record model.
- Compatibility wrappers may be required for existing `spec/specs/*` and
  `experimental/*` links.
- Feature-impacting PRs gain a new maintenance requirement: update the feature
  record, not only code/tests.

## Repository contracts

This ADR does not replace ADR-009's full repository structure. It amends the
parts that define feature ownership:

```text
features/<feature-slug>/
  README.md
  spec.md
  status.md
  evidence.md
  security.md
  changelog.md

node/src/stigmem_node/features/<feature_name>/
  # core/default implementation when shipped inside stigmem-node

features/<feature-slug>/src/
  # plugin or opt-in implementation when the feature is its own package

spec/specs/
  # compatibility/generated views over feature specs during migration

docs/docs/
  # public projections and narrative docs

docs/internal/releases/
  # release contracts
```

## Acceptance criteria

This ADR is implemented when:

- `features/README.md` defines the feature record registry.
- A feature template contains all required files and metadata examples.
- CI validates required feature files and frontmatter for migrated features.
- At least one core feature and one plugin-backed feature have complete feature
  records.
- High-level docs link to feature records instead of duplicating feature detail
  where practical.
- Migration sequencing is tracked outside the ADR.
