# Stigmem Spec — Index

This directory contains the canonical specification for the stigmem federated knowledge protocol.

## Canonical spec

**[`stigmem-spec-v0.9.0a1.md`](stigmem-spec-v0.9.0a1.md)** is the canonical specification as of 2026-05-09. Per [ADR-001](../docs/adr/001-versioning.md) + [ADR-019](../docs/adr/019-amendment-to-adr-001-prerelease-version-strings.md), v0.9.0a1 is the first build of stigmem; the version *markers* on earlier evolutionary checkpoints labeled internal development steps, not tagged releases.

The ADR-010 component specs are the active protocol decomposition. The
monolithic v0.9.0a1 file remains as the historical disposition map and bridge
for legacy section numbers.

### Section disposition (full table in the canonical spec)

| Section group | Status | Destination |
|---|---|---|
| §1–§14 (core protocol foundation) | Stable in v0.9.0a1 | `spec/specs/` component specs, plus monolithic overview/governance bridge prose |
| §15 Decay, §16 Synthesis | Deferred per [ADR-002](../docs/adr/002-v1-scope.md) | [`features/decay/spec.md`](../features/decay/spec.md), [`features/synthesis/spec.md`](../features/synthesis/spec.md) |
| §17 Memory Garden | Basic concept stable; advanced ACL deferred per [ADR-011](../docs/adr/011-cross-cutting-extraction.md) | [`specs/02-scopes-and-acl.md`](specs/02-scopes-and-acl.md), [`specs/08-quarantine-garden.md`](specs/08-quarantine-garden.md), [`features/memory-garden-acl/spec.md`](../features/memory-garden-acl/spec.md) |
| §18 Source Attestation | Deferred / experimental plugin | [`features/source-attestation/spec.md`](../features/source-attestation/spec.md) |
| §19 Federation Trust | Basic stable (mTLS, capability tokens); advanced trust scoring deferred | [`specs/04-manifests.md`](specs/04-manifests.md), [`specs/05-federation-trust.md`](specs/05-federation-trust.md), [`specs/06-capability-tokens.md`](specs/06-capability-tokens.md) |
| §20 Recall and Graph (advanced) | Deferred | [`features/recall-graph/spec.md`](../features/recall-graph/spec.md) |
| Subscriptions / push federation | Deferred | [`features/subscriptions/spec.md`](../features/subscriptions/spec.md) |
| §21 Lazy Instruction Discovery | Deferred / experimental plugin | [`features/lazy-instruction-discovery/spec.md`](../features/lazy-instruction-discovery/spec.md) |
| §22 Security Hardening | Stable | [`specs/09-audit-log.md`](specs/09-audit-log.md), [`specs/10-hardening.md`](specs/10-hardening.md), [`specs/11-replay-protection.md`](specs/11-replay-protection.md) |
| §23 RTBF Tombstones | Deferred / experimental plugin | [`features/tombstones/spec.md`](../features/tombstones/spec.md) |
| §24 Time-Travel Queries | Deferred / experimental plugin | [`features/time-travel/spec.md`](../features/time-travel/spec.md) |
| §25 Content-Addressed Fact IDs (CIDs) | **Stable in core** per [ADR-017](../docs/adr/017-amendment-to-adr-011-cids-as-core.md) | [`features/content-addressed-ids/spec.md`](../features/content-addressed-ids/spec.md) |

## Modular spec migration (ADR-010)

Per [ADR-010](../docs/adr/010-modular-specs.md), supported component specs live
under [`spec/specs/`](specs/) with independent versioning. Experimental specs
remain colocated with their feature code under
[`experimental/<feature>/spec.md`](../experimental/). [`PROTOCOL.md`](PROTOCOL.md)
is generated from those files' YAML frontmatter and records the current
protocol composition.

## Evolution

The protocol-spec content evolved through development checkpoints from pre-reset to v2.0. Snapshots preserved at [`spec/archive/evolution/`](archive/evolution/) — see that directory's README. The development-checkpoint changelog is at [`spec/EVOLUTION.md`](EVOLUTION.md) (renamed from `spec/CHANGELOG.md` 2026-05-09 per master-checklist §4.3a). The protocol-release-level changelog going forward is at [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) at repo root.
