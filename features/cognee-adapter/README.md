# Cognee Adapter

The Cognee adapter bridges Stigmem atomic facts with Cognee's knowledge-graph
layer. It serializes facts into structured text for Cognee ingestion and maps
Cognee semantic-search results back into Stigmem-shaped fact records.

The adapter source exists under `experimental/cognee-adapter`. It is packaged
as an experimental opt-in plugin for the v0.9.0a10 adapter publication batch.
Installing the package makes the plugin discoverable; host applications still
choose when to call the Cognee bridge.
