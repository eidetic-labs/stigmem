# Async Jobs

Async jobs are the node-local background execution path for long-running lint
and decay sweeps. Small scopes return synchronous HTTP 200 responses. Scopes
above the configured threshold can return HTTP 202 with a job id that callers
poll until completion.

The feature is experimental and outside the default product surface. It is
implemented in core node routes and job storage rather than as a plugin.
Detailed lint and decay semantics remain owned by their respective feature or
spec records; this feature owns the shared job lifecycle, polling shape,
threshold behavior, and cross-type isolation.
