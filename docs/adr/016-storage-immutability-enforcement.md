# ADR-016: Storage immutability enforcement

<p className="stigmem-meta"><span>8 min read</span><span>Accepted</span><span>Recorded 2026-05-07</span></p>

<div className="stigmem-lead">

**What this ADR decides**

A four-layer defense-in-depth immutability stack (architectural,
trigger-level, cryptographic, sequence, external-witness) that makes
fact tampering detectable even under admin compromise. The Sigstore
Rekor anchor at L5 is the layer that makes the "facts are immutable"
claim durable against R-23.

</div>

<div className="stigmem-keypoint">

**Stigmem's spec claims facts are immutable. A code audit reveals the claim is structurally unsupported.**

The <code>facts</code> table in <code>node/migrations/001_init.sql</code>
has no triggers, no permission denials, no mechanism preventing
UPDATE or DELETE. Application code issues <code>UPDATE facts</code> in
at least seven distinct places. Immutability is by convention only,
and the convention is already partially violated by core paths.

</div>

**Date:** 2026-05-07 · **Authors:** Eidetic Labs · **Related:** [ADR-001](./001-versioning), [ADR-003](./003-prompt-injection) (load-bearing dependency on immutability), [ADR-011](./011-cross-cutting-extraction), [ADR-017](./017-amendment-to-adr-011-cids-as-core); threat model R-09, **R-23 (admin-level storage tampering)**

## Context

This is not just a technical-debt issue. **ADR-003's prompt-injection
trust boundary depends on storage immutability.** The L2 rule
(federation cannot promote `interpret_as` on replication) assumes the
storage `interpret_as` value is trustworthy. If an attacker can mutate
facts in place — change `value_v` to malicious payloads, change
`interpret_as` from `content` to `instruction` — ADR-003's structural
defenses are bypassed by storage compromise, not by federation.

<div className="stigmem-keypoint">

**R-23: admin-level storage tampering / fact mutation attack.**

A malicious actor with admin-level privileges on a stigmem node (via
supply-chain compromise, credential theft, insider threat, or operator
error) overwrites existing facts with malicious instruction payloads.
The mutated facts are served through stigmem's federated recall path
to consuming LLM agents, executing data exfiltration or arbitrary
commands.

</div>

This is a credible threat that local enforcement alone cannot defeat:
an attacker with admin privileges controls the database, the
application code, the migrations, the file system, and the verifier.
**Every layer that lives entirely on the compromised node is
theoretically bypassable.** The only durable defense is anchoring
fact integrity to evidence the attacker does not control.

## Decision

Adopt a four-layer immutability stack as the v1.0 baseline.

</div>

### Layer 1 (L1) · Append-only journal + projection tables

The `facts` table becomes append-only by application architecture.
Mutating paths refactor to write to projection tables that are
explicitly mutable, while the source-of-truth `facts` table accepts
only INSERT.

<div className="stigmem-fields">

<div>
<dt>Projection table</dt>
<dt><span className="stigmem-fields__type">Replaces</span></dt>
<dd>Mutation site</dd>
</div>

<dt><code>fact_garden_membership</code></dt>
<dt><span className="stigmem-fields__type">garden assignment</span></dt>
<dd>Was <code>UPDATE facts ...</code> from <code>gardens.py</code>.</dd>
</div>

</div>

Retraction model unchanged: retraction stays as a new fact assertion
per spec; the retraction *event* lands in `fact_retractions` (already
append-only per the comment in `routes/facts.py:171`). Read-path
queries against `facts` join projection tables for derived state.

~1–2 weeks; touches every read path and every mutation site. Eliminates
the entire class of accidental-mutation bugs.

### Layer 2 (L2) · SQLite triggers

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER facts_no_update
    BEFORE UPDATE ON facts
    BEGIN SELECT RAISE(ABORT, 'facts are append-only (ADR-016)'); END;

CREATE TRIGGER facts_no_delete
    BEFORE DELETE ON facts
    BEGIN SELECT RAISE(ABORT, 'facts are append-only (ADR-016)'); END;
```

Catches any code path that goes around L1's discipline — application
bugs, contributor mistakes, third-party library interactions. Does not
defeat an admin-level attacker (who can `DROP TRIGGER` or edit the
database file directly), but raises the cost and makes non-admin
tampering immediately visible.

Audit events: `fact_mutation_attempted` fires on trigger activation.
Operators monitor this; non-zero counts are anomalous.

### Layer 3 (L3) · Content-addressed fact IDs

Every fact carries a CID (per spec §25): a hash computed
deterministically over the fact's canonical body. On read, the CID is
recomputed and compared.

<div className="stigmem-grid">

<div><h4>Mutation detection</h4><p>If <code>value_v</code> or any CID-covered field is mutated post-insert, the recomputed CID does not match the stored CID. Read path returns an integrity error.</p></div>
<div><h4>Federation included</h4><p>The CID is included in the fact when it federates to peers. Peers can recompute CIDs from canonical body and compare.</p></div>
<div><h4>CID-keyed federation</h4><p>Federation operates on CIDs, not opaque IDs — peers verify content matches expectations.</p></div>

</div>

<div className="stigmem-keypoint">

**This requires moving CIDs from a plugin (per ADR-011 C1 architecture) back to core.**

ADR-017 commits to that move. CIDs are no longer opt-in; they are part
of the v1.0 critical path because R-23 mitigation depends on them.

</div>

The CID computation covers: `entity`, `relation`, `value_type`,
`value_v`, `source`, `timestamp`, **`interpret_as`** (added per
ADR-003), `scope`. Mutation of any of these by an attacker breaks the
CID — including the critical case of changing `interpret_as` from
`content` to `instruction`.

### Layer 4 (L4) · Local hash chain

A `fact_chain` table records a hash chain over fact insert events:

```
chain_index | fact_cid              | prev_chain_hash | this_chain_hash
0           | <CID of first fact>   | (genesis)       | h(genesis || cid_0)
1           | <CID of second fact>  | h(genesis|cid_0)| h(prev || cid_1)
...
```

Each new fact append produces a new chain entry. Sequence tampering
(removal, reordering, insertion at an arbitrary point) breaks the
chain at the tampered index.

Per-read overhead: optional verification — clients can request the
chain proof for a returned fact and verify locally. Not all reads
require verification; cross-org / federated reads should verify by
default.

L4 is included in v1.0 because it pairs with L5 cleanly (the chain
checkpoints are what get committed to the external witness).

### Layer 5 (L5) · Sigstore Rekor anchor

The crucial layer for R-23. Stigmem commits chain checkpoints (every
Nth fact, or at minimum every minute under sustained writes) to
Sigstore Rekor or an equivalent transparency log.

<div className="stigmem-grid">

<div><h4>Independently operated</h4><p>Rekor's append-only log is operated independently. The stigmem node operator does not control it.</p></div>
<div><h4>Witnessed externally</h4><p>The Rekor log is itself transparency-logged and witnessed by external parties (Sigstore's network of monitors).</p></div>
<div><h4>Divergence detectable</h4><p>If an attacker mutates facts and rewrites the local chain, post-attack chain checkpoints will not match the Rekor entries committed before the attack. Anyone comparing local state to Rekor sees the divergence immediately.</p></div>

</div>

The attacker cannot modify or remove Rekor entries previously
committed, nor backdate new ones. The attacker can continue serving
consistent local lies until someone checks against Rekor —
**mitigated by mandatory verification on cross-org / federated
reads.**

### Client / peer verification (operationalizing L5)

Recall responses include, in addition to the fact body, the fact's
CID, the chain proof (chain_index, prev_chain_hash, this_chain_hash),
and the Rekor inclusion proof for the most recent checkpoint covering
this fact's chain index.

<ol className="stigmem-steps">
<li>Recompute CID from fact body; check it matches.</li>
<li>Recompute chain hash for the fact's chain entry; check it links correctly.</li>
<li>Verify Rekor inclusion proof against Rekor's known root.</li>
</ol>

Federation peers do this verification automatically on inbound
replication. Clients can opt in via a `Stigmem-Verify: full` header
(per ADR-012's `Stigmem-Version` model).

<div className="stigmem-keypoint">

**Without client/peer verification, L5 provides no defense in practice.**

This is the most-overlooked part of transparency-log architectures:
the witness is only useful if someone checks it.

</div>

### Optional · hardware enforcement (deployment-specific)

For adopters with regulatory requirements (HIPAA, SOX, FedRAMP,
regulated finance), additional hardware-level options are documented
but not required:

<div className="stigmem-grid">

<div><h4>WORM storage</h4><p>S3 Object Lock, write-once disks. Hardware-level append-only enforcement. Even root cannot overwrite.</p></div>
<div><h4>TEE / enclave</h4><p>SGX, AMD SEV, ARM TrustZone. Code runs in a protected boundary the host OS cannot reach.</p></div>
<div><h4>HSM-backed signing</h4><p>For chain checkpoints. Keys cannot be extracted even by privileged users. Strengthens L4.</p></div>

</div>

Stigmem core ships compatibly with them but does not require them.

## Consequences

### What gets easier

<div className="stigmem-grid">

<div><h4>Immutability claim is enforceable</h4><p>L1+L2 catches bugs and accidents; L3 catches content tampering; L4+L5 catch admin-level tampering.</p></div>
<div><h4>R-23 mitigation is structural</h4><p>Operators don't need to trust admin discipline; the architecture itself constrains what an admin-level attacker can silently do.</p></div>
<div><h4>ADR-003 holds against storage compromise</h4><p>The <code>interpret_as</code> field is part of the CID; mutating it breaks integrity. The L2 federation rule is now backstopped by L3 storage tamper-detection.</p></div>
<div><h4>Federation peers verify independently</h4><p>No need to trust a peer's claim about a fact's content; CIDs + chain proofs let any peer verify against Rekor.</p></div>
<div><h4>Audit log integrity inherits the pattern</h4><p>R-09 gets the same treatment. This ADR establishes the pattern for facts and audit logs alike.</p></div>
<div><h4>Compliance posture improves</h4><p>Tamper-evident audit with external attestation is the standard for HIPAA, SOX, FedRAMP, and regulated finance.</p></div>

</div>

### What gets harder

<div className="stigmem-grid">

<div><h4>Phase B timeline grows ~6–9 weeks</h4><p>L1 ~1–2w, L2 ~3d, L3 ~1w, L4 ~2w, L5 ~2–3w (Rekor), verification ~1w.</p></div>
<div><h4>Application refactor is real</h4><p>Seven existing mutation paths redesigned around projection tables. ~10 files touched, comprehensive test coverage for behavioral parity.</p></div>
<div><h4>Read-path overhead</h4><p>Every read with verification costs CID recompute + chain hash + Rekor inclusion proof. Acceptable for federated cross-org; optional for trusted-local.</p></div>
<div><h4>Operator complexity</h4><p>Rekor key management, witness availability, retention policy, monitoring of <code>fact_mutation_attempted</code>. Documented in <code>docs/Operate/Hardening</code>.</p></div>
<div><h4>Storage growth</h4><p>Chain table grows monotonically; Rekor entries cost (Sigstore is free for OSS, rate-limited at volume).</p></div>

## Implementation plan

The immutability stack lands in Phase B. Sequenced to minimize parallel
risk.

<ol className="stigmem-steps">
<li><strong>B.1 · ADR-017 amendment to ADR-011 (move CIDs to core).</strong> ~1 day. Lands first because it changes the plugin scope of CIDs.</li>
<li><strong>B.2 · L1 architectural refactor.</strong> ~1–2 weeks. Adds projection tables; refactors all seven mutation paths. CI gate: existing tests pass; new property test verifies <code>facts</code> table only ever sees INSERT.</li>
<li><strong>B.3 · L2 SQLite triggers.</strong> ~3 days. New migration. CI gate: triggers exercised by negative tests.</li>
<li><strong>B.4 · L3 CID enforcement.</strong> ~1 week. Per spec §25 design. Verification at read time. CI gate: tamper test mutates a fact's <code>value_v</code> directly via SQL; recall returns integrity error.</li>
<li><strong>B.5 · L4 hash chain.</strong> ~2 weeks. New <code>fact_chain</code> table; chain computation on every insert; chain proof in recall responses. CI gate: chain-rewrite test detects manual rewrite.</li>
<li><strong>B.6 · L5 Rekor integration.</strong> ~2–3 weeks. Rekor SDK in node, checkpoint commit (every Nth fact or every 60 seconds), inclusion proof in recall responses, verification helper in SDK, operator runbook for Rekor unavailability.</li>
<li><strong>B.7 · Client / peer verification.</strong> ~1 week. Verification helpers in Python SDK, federation inbound automatic verification, <code>Stigmem-Verify</code> header support per ADR-012.</li>
<li><strong>B.8 · Operator hardening doc.</strong> ~3–5 days. <code>docs/Operate/Hardening</code> and <code>docs/Secure/Immutability-and-attestation</code> per ADR-005 IA.</li>
</ol>

**Total Phase B addition:** ~6–9 weeks.

## Amendment process

Changes to this ADR require sign-off per ADR-001 §Contributor approval
rule. Common amendment cases: changing the layer composition (e.g.,
dropping a layer); changing the witness service away from Rekor;
changing default verification posture (verify-by-default vs. opt-in);
adding hardware enforcement requirements at the protocol level.
