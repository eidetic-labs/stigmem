# systemd Deployment

The systemd deployment feature contains the experimental bare-metal Linux
recipe for running a Stigmem node without Docker. It includes installer
guidance, an environment template, a systemd unit, hardening options, reverse
proxy guidance, offline install notes, logging, upgrade, smoke-test, and
uninstall commands under `experimental/deploy-systemd`.

systemd remains outside the current supported alpha deployment surface. Docker
Compose is the supported default path; systemd remains deferred until live
distro validation, installer review, hardening review, upgrade/rollback
validation, offline-install validation, and ownership gates complete.
