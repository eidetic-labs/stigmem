# Letta Adapter

The Letta adapter bridges Stigmem shared coordination facts with Letta
per-agent archival memory. It writes Stigmem facts into a Letta agent as tagged
archival passages and can read Letta archival memory back as Stigmem-shaped
records.

The adapter source exists under `experimental/letta-adapter` and is packaged as
`stigmem-plugin-letta-adapter` for the v0.9.0a10 adapter publication batch. It
remains experimental and host-application opt-in; live Letta validation is
operator-owned for v0.1.0.
