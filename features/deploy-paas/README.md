# PaaS Deployment

The PaaS deployment feature contains experimental recipes for running a
Stigmem node on managed container platforms: Render, Railway, AWS App Runner,
and Google Cloud Run. The implementation source under `experimental/deploy-paas`
captures platform-specific build, environment, secrets, health-check,
persistence, and rollback guidance.

PaaS remains outside the current supported alpha deployment surface. Docker
Compose is the supported default path; PaaS remains deferred until live
platform validation, secrets posture review, persistence validation, cost and
scaling review, and ownership gates complete.
